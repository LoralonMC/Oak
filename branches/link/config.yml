      By linking your account, you get your in-game ranks and username applied on Discord.

      **How to link:**
      1. Log in to the Minecraft server
      2. Type `/discord link` in chat
      3. Send the code you receive to the Discord bot

      Once linked, your Discord roles will sync with your in-game ranks.
